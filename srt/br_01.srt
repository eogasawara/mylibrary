00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This presentation introduces DAL Toolbox, a comprehensive open-source library

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
designed to make data analytics workflows more modular, transparent, and

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
reproducible. It was developed through collaboration between CEFET/RJ, LNCC and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
INRIA, reflecting an international research effort. The toolbox is openly

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
available on GitHub, reinforcing its community-driven and academic character. Our

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
goal here is to explain why DAL Toolbox was created,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
what problem it solves, and how it supports systematic experimentation.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The foundation of the toolbox is Experiment Lines, a concept

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
adapted from Software Product Lines. This framework allows researchers and

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
practitioners to create families of experiments rather than isolated pipelines.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It addresses the critical challenges of modern data analytics: growing

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
complexity, need for reproducibility, and integration across diverse tools. By

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the end of this talk, you will see how DAL

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Toolbox can accelerate research, improve transparency, and support production-level adoption.
