00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,818
The case study illustrates DAL Toolbox in action using

2
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:09,636
meteorological data from Florida airports. The task was rainfall

3
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:14,455
prediction, leveraging features like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:19,273
sky coverage. The initial baseline used KNN directly on raw

5
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:24,091
features without preprocessing. Next, SVM was applied with PCA,

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,909
improving dimensionality reduction and robustness. The workflow then evolved

7
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:33,727
into a Random Forest classifier with normalization. Finally, a

8
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:38,545
tuned Random Forest was deployed with hyperparameter optimization. Each configuration

9
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:43,364
built upon the previous one, showing how Experiment Lines

10
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:48,182
enable systematic workflow evolution. This case demonstrates the reproducibility

11
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:53,000
and flexibility of DAL Toolbox in real-world data science applications.
