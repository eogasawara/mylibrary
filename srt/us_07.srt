1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,750
One-hot encoding is the safest default choice for most algorithms.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,500
It prevents false order and works with linear and neural models.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,250
Its drawback is high dimensionality when categories are many. Label

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,000
encoding is simpler but risky for models sensitive to ordering. It

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,750
is suitable for tree-based models that do not assume numeric order.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,500
Target encoding replaces categories with aggregated values. This works well

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,250
with high-cardinality variables. However, it may cause data leakage if applied

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,000
incorrectly. Choosing the right encoding depends on the model and dataset.
