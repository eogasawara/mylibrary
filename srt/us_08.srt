Data cleaning is the foundation of reliable machine learning. NA

removal is fast but may reduce dataset size and introduce bias.

00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:14,143
Categorical mapping ensures that variables are properly represented. Encoding strategy must

4
00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:18,857
align with the chosen algorithm. One-hot is safe for most models,

5
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:23,571
while label encoding works with trees. Target encoding requires care to

6
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:28,286
avoid leakage. Preprocessing decisions must always match the data and context.

7
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:33,000
By applying these steps, we ensure clean inputs and trustworthy models.
