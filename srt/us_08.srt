1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,842
The performance comparison illustrates how each model iteration contributed

2
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:09,684
to refining the rainfall prediction pipeline. The baseline KNN classifier

3
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:14,526
was simple and interpretable, but it showed weak predictive accuracy

4
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:19,368
and struggled with noisy data. The SVM combined with PCA

5
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:24,211
provided significant improvements by reducing dimensionality and capturing non-linear

6
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:29,053
relationships, which led to stronger recall values. Random Forest introduced

7
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:33,895
an ensemble strategy that balanced precision and recall more effectively,

8
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:38,737
offering a robust middle ground between complexity and performance. Finally,

9
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:43,579
the tuned Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters achieved the best

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,421
overall results, with an F1 score of 0.948. This

11
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:53,263
result demonstrates that systematic exploration through Experiment Lines is far

12
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:58,105
superior to isolated, one-off experiments. Each step in the workflow

13
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:02,947
was not discarded but built upon the knowledge gained from

14
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:07,789
earlier iterations. This approach showcases how DAL Toolbox promotes reproducibility:

15
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:12,632
every change, every experiment, is documented and comparable. The

16
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:17,474
results confirm that Experiment Lines not only improve model accuracy

17
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:22,316
but also accelerate the research process by structuring how alternatives

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:27,158
are tested. In practice, this methodology supports both academic research

19
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:32,000
and industry applications where high performance and reproducibility are essential.
