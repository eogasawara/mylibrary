00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,625
Using the DAL Toolbox, we apply the categ_mapping function to the

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:09,250
Species column of the iris dataset. This transformation creates three binary

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,875
columns, one for each species. Each row receives a value of

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:18,500
one in the correct column and zero in the others. This

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,125
guarantees that categories are represented independently. The mapping object can be

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:27,750
reused consistently across training and test sets. This is essential for

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,375
reproducible experiments and deployment. The slide shows only part of the

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,000
implementation. The complete code is available in the DAL Toolbox GitHub repository.
