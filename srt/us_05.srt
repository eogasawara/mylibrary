00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,833
DAL Toolbox offers practical functionality across the entire

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,667
machine learning pipeline. For transformations, users can perform min-max

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:14,500
scaling, z-score normalization, PCA, and feature selection. For

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,333
modeling, the toolbox supports algorithms like KNN, linear regression,

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:24,167
Random Forest, and SVM. Clustering options include K-Means,

6
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:29,000
providing accessible methods for segmentation tasks. Visualization covers scatter

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,833
plots for relationships, histograms for distributions, and line

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:38,667
plots for time series. The unified API ensures that

9
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,500
switching between models or transformations requires minimal code

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,333
changes. This makes experimentation both flexible and consistent. Overall,

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:53,167
DAL Toolbox provides a cohesive set of tools

12
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:58,000
designed to work harmoniously within the Experiment Lines framework.
