Most algorithms require numeric inputs. Raw categories like colors or

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:09,750
labels cannot be processed directly. If categories are encoded as

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,625
integers, algorithms may assume a false order. For instance, 'red=1,

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,500
blue=2, green=3' implies that blue is greater than red. This

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,375
introduces relationships that do not exist. One-hot encoding solves this

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,250
by creating separate binary columns. Each column represents the presence

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,125
of a specific category. This transformation is critical for linear

00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:39,000
models and neural networks. Without it, models may learn incorrect patterns.
