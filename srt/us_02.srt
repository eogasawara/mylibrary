00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,833
Today’s data-driven world involves high-frequency and high-volume streams across

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:09,667
domains like finance, healthcare, urban mobility, and IoT. Traditional approaches

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:14,500
struggle with the scale and heterogeneity of these datasets. Constructing

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,333
workflows that are both complete and reproducible remains a major

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:24,167
bottleneck. A key issue lies in integration: data scientists often

6
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:29,000
juggle multiple libraries with different interfaces and dependencies. This increases

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,833
the learning curve and leads to fragmented solutions. Transparency

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:38,667
is another challenge: workflows must be clear and interpretable, not

9
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,500
hidden inside opaque pipelines. Reusability is also essential—components should be

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,333
easy to transfer between projects. Finally, workflows must support variability,

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:53,167
allowing researchers to try multiple configurations without starting from scratch.

12
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:58,000
DAL Toolbox was designed precisely to address these pain points.
