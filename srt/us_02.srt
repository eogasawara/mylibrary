00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Missing values often arise from survey errors, sensor failures, or

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
incomplete records. Understanding the cause is critical for choosing the

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
right strategy. If missingness is not random, analysis may become

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
biased. For example, certain groups may systematically omit responses. Algorithms

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that receive NA values often fail or silently produce wrong

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
results. Preprocessing ensures that models can be trained without interruption.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Two main strategies exist: removal and imputation. Each has trade-offs,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the choice depends on the dataset and the problem context.
