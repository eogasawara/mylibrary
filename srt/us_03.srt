00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,846
The core innovation of DAL Toolbox is the application

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:09,692
of Experiment Lines. Experiment Lines borrow ideas from Software Product

3
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:14,538
Lines, enabling systematic reuse and controlled variation in workflows.

4
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:19,385
In practice, this means that each component of a workflow—transformation,

5
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:24,231
modeling, evaluation—can be optional, interchangeable, or parameterized. This flexibility

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:29,077
allows us to configure entire families of experiments from a

7
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:33,923
single base structure. It fundamentally changes how data scientists

8
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:38,769
explore alternatives: instead of building new pipelines from scratch, they

9
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:43,615
evolve workflows step by step. Variability and optionality ensure

10
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:48,462
that workflows can adapt to different needs while preserving their

11
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:53,308
core integrity. The result is more efficient research, reproducibility,

12
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,154
and comparability across experiments. Experiment Lines thus transform workflow design

13
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:03,000
from a rigid process into a systematic and transparent methodology.
