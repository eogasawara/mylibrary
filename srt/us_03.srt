00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,750
In this example, we artificially introduce a missing value into the

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,500
iris dataset. We then use the na.omit function to remove rows

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,250
containing NAs. The dataset size changes from 150 to 149 rows.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,000
This simple approach ensures that no NA remains in the data.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,750
However, it is important to emphasize that valuable information may be

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,500
lost. Removing rows reduces sample size, which may affect results. This

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,250
method is suitable for quick exploration but not always for production.
