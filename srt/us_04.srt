00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,818
The architecture of DAL Toolbox follows a modular design

2
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:09,636
with clear separation of concerns. Each module—transformation, classification, regression,

3
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:14,455
clustering, and visualization—serves a distinct purpose. Transformations include operations

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:19,273
like normalization, scaling, and dimensionality reduction. Classification and regression

5
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:24,091
modules support supervised learning tasks for both categorical and

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,909
continuous outputs. Clustering enables unsupervised discovery of structures and

7
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:33,727
patterns in data. Visualization tools allow users to interpret

8
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:38,545
results through plots, histograms, scatter plots, and time series

9
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:43,364
analysis. All modules interoperate seamlessly through a unified API.

10
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:48,182
This modularity not only simplifies maintenance but also allows

11
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:53,000
easy extension and integration with external libraries such as Scikit-learn.
