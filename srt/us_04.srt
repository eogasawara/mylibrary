00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,875
Removing missing values is fast and convenient. It can be

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:09,750
done in a single line of code. However, this speed comes

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,625
at the cost of precision. Entire rows may be discarded even

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,500
if only one value is missing. If missingness follows a systematic

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,375
pattern, deletion amplifies bias. For example, if high-income individuals skip

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,250
income questions, results become skewed. This method works best when missingness

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,125
is rare and random. For production systems, imputation is often a

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:39,000
better choice. Always balance speed and reliability when choosing this strategy
