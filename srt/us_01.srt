Data quality is the cornerstone of any machine learning project.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,500
Without proper cleaning and representation, algorithms cannot produce reliable results. Data

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,250
cleaning systematically removes errors, inconsistencies, and noise from raw datasets.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,000
Representation ensures that algorithms can interpret variables in a meaningful way.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,750
The DAL Toolbox provides functions that make these steps reproducible. In

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,500
this talk, we will cover missing value handling and categorical

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,250
encoding. These are the two most common issues encountered during preprocessing.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,000
By addressing them properly, we establish the foundation for accurate models.
